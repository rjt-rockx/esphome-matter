ESPHome external component adding Matter 1.6 support.

Derived from [DavidvtWout/esphome-matter](https://github.com/DavidvtWout/esphome-matter) (Apache-2.0), with modifications. See NOTICE.

> This project is still in early-development so don't expect a perfectly working setup. Both
> matter-over-wifi and matter-over-thread are now working. It's possible to commission a
> device to a matter controller, and lights, switches and sensors are mostly working.
> Many other device types can also be created and interacted with using on_attribute triggers
> and set_attribute actions.
>
> However, there are still some stability issues, mainly with reconnection after a restart which
> may take up to a minute.
>
> Also, keep in mind that the config schema may still change and break existing configurations.

That being said, esphome-matter is usable now, so give it a try!

# Supported Hardware

The component only supports `ESP32` targets built with the **ESP-IDF** framework. The Arduino framework is not
supported.

Connectivity depends on which ESPHome networking components are configured:

- **Matter-over-Wi-Fi**: If `wifi` is configured, Matter announces itself over mDNS and can be commissioned
  on the network.
- **Matter-over-Thread**: Requires the `openthread` component and ESPHome **2026.6.0** or newer.
- **Matter-over-Ethernet**: Isn't supported yet and isn't actively being worked on. Feel free to implement it ;)
- **BLE commissioning**: Currently broken, but this is something that I want to work on. The idea is that esphome-matter falls back to BLE commissioning (the default for most matter devices) when no `wifi`, `openthread`, or `ethernet` component is configured.

Binding (for example, a button to a light) is working but still has some stability issues. Sometimes it takes a few
seconds before a command is successfully sent.

So far, `ESP32-C3`, `ESP32-C5`, `ESP32-C6`, `ESP32-S3` and `ESP32-H2` have been tested and confirmed to work!

# Commissioning

Because ESPHome devices already have their Wi-Fi or Thread credentials from your YAML configuration, commissioning
works differently than with most other Matter devices. You still need to commission the device to a Matter fabric, but
this does not happen over BLE (bluetooth) like with most matter devices.

After flashing, the device prints a setup code (`SetupQRCode`) to the logs on every boot:

```
[C][matter]: Matter:
[C][matter]:   SetupQRCode: MT:Y.K904QI14-O992WI00
[C][matter]:   QR URL: https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT:Y.K904QI14-O992WI00
[C][matter]:   Manual pairing code: 32552014321
[C][matter]:   Commissioning window: open
[C][matter]:   Fabrics: none
```

Copy the `SetupQRCode` or open the link and scan the QR-code to commission the device. Keep in mind that the
commissioning window remains open for only 15 minutes. A restart of the device will re-open the window if it hasn't
joined any fabrics yet.

Once the device has joined a fabric, the commissioning window won't be opened on restarts anymore. Matter controllers
should be able to share the device. This generates a temporary commissioning code and re-opens the commissioning window.
If you lose access to the Matter controller, you can do a Matter factory reset (see [Example config](#example-config)).

### Ecosystem specific settings

- **Home Assistant / matterjs server**: Start the matterjs-server with: `matterjs-server --enable-test-net-dcl=true`. Commission the device with the `Commission existing device` option.
- **Home Assistant Matter app (HA-OS only)**: Check the "Enable test-net DCL usage" box under Settings -> Apps -> Matter Server -> Configuration. If you do not do this, pairing will fail.
- **Google Home**: Doesn't automatically accept devices with the "test" vendor ID. Follow the [Tasmota guide](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Matter-with-Google/) to add esphome-matter devices.

So far, **IKEA Home Smart**, **Apple Home**, and **Amazon Alexa** have been confirmed to accept esphome-matter devices
without any special configuration steps. Keep in mind that "accepting" a device doesn't mean supporting it properly. For
example, IKEA Home Smart only supports a very limited subset of Matter device types. To get most out of the device, share
it with a fabric that is controlled by Home Assistant.

Please [report](https://github.com/DavidvtWout/esphome-matter/discussions/44) any outdated or newly discovered information
on compatible ecosystems, devices, and device types or issues.

More information about endpoints and a full list of supported device types can be found in [docs/endpoints.md](./docs/endpoints.md)

# Lights

All four Matter lights are now fully supported by esphome-matter! See [docs/lights.md](./docs/lights.md) for more information.
Also check out [examples/extended-color-light.yaml](./examples/extended-color-light.yaml) for an example of how to configure a light in esphome-matter.

# Sensors

Matter can expose many ESPHome sensor values. To expose a sensor, first create a device type that supports it and then map sensor ids to it. The supported sensor device types include `temperature_sensor`, `humidity_sensor`, `light_sensor`, `pressure_sensor`, `flow_sensor`, `contact_sensor`, `occupancy_sensor`, and `air_quality_sensor`. See [docs/device-types.md](docs/device-types.md) for a more complete overview of how to configure these sensors.

The [all-sensors example](examples/all-sensors.yaml) also shows how to expose all supported sensors.

# Actions

See [docs/actions.md](./docs/actions.md) for a more complete overview of available actions.

### OnOff

[OnOff commands](./docs/actions.md#onoff-cluster) are used for simple binary devices such as lights, plugs and relays.

```yaml
# Turn off, turn on, or toggle a bound device.
matter.send_command: some_endpoint.on_off.on
matter.send_command: some_endpoint.on_off.on
matter.send_command: some_endpoint.on_off.toggle

# Intended for motion sensors temporarily turning on a light.
matter.send_command:
  path: some_endpoint.on_off.on_with_timed_off
  arguments:
    on_time: # s - How long to turn on the light.
    # off_wait_time: 0s  # Time before accepting another on_with_timed_off command.
    # on_off_control: 0
```

### LevelControl

[LevelControl commands](./docs/actions.md#levelcontrol-cluster) are used for dimming. YAML values can be percentages or raw Matter brightness levels, normally `0` to `254`.

The following commands also have a version without `_with_on_off`. These commands don't turn on or off the light.

```yaml
# Move directly to a brightness level.
matter.send_command:
  path: some_endpoint.level_control.move_to_level_with_on_off
  arguments:
    level: # %
    # transition_time: 0s

# Move continuously up or down.
matter.send_command:
  path: some_endpoint.level_control.move_with_on_off
  arguments:
    move_mode: # either "up" or "down"
    rate: # %/s

# Step once by a fixed amount.
matter.send_command:
  path: some_endpoint.level_control.step_with_on_off
  arguments:
    step_mode: # either "up" or "down"
    step_size: # %
    # transition_time: 0s

# Stop a previous move command.
matter.send_command: some_endpoint.level_control.stop_with_on_off
```

# Current Limitations

- As this is based on [Espressif's SDK for Matter (esp-matter)](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_matter/) any features/functions not supported there in upstream first can not be supported in this project.
- BLE commissioning is currently broken and if it wasn't, it cannot be combined with the `api` component because of limitations in the ESPHome `network` component.
